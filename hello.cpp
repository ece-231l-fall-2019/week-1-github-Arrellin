Im in this class because one 2007 christmas we bought a mac desktop and that was a rabbit hole that lead me here. To me technology is pretty damn near magical, i fell in love with beautiful graphics in games, so i built a pc. I somehow found so much pleasure in trouble shooting my computer and practically everyone elses i knew that yea it just stuck. I love computers and technology but I understand nothing about it.
